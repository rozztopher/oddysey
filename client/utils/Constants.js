    q: "WHO IS JACK IRVING?",
    a: "Jack Irving is a multidisciplinary artist and designer originally from the British seaside town Blackpool who now runs his world-renowned design studio in London. Jack creates collections of wearable art: both physical and now also metaverse-ready digital pieces, creating his own cosmic worlds of his hyper-reality. Jack’s futuristic vision fuses the worlds of fantasy and experimental design and his creative mission is to engulf the world in a fantastical spectacle, incorporating all elements of theatricality with a love for colliding technology and innovation with live performance.",

    q: "WHAT IS ALMA?",
    a: "Alma is an early-stage technology company driven by a passion for contemporary art, fashion and popular culture, a love of music and a desire to transform the way people interact with these in emerging digital spaces.",
  },
  {
    q: "WHAT IS ODYSSEY?",
    a: "The Odyssey genesis drop consists of six different digital collective towers based on IRL sculptures by Jack which will randomly allocate one-per-wallet as a free mint, open first to allowlist, then to waitlist,  and then as a public mint. Engaged collectors who manage to collect all six tower designs will be rewarded with a seventh totally unique tower design which will be airdropped directly to their wallet post-mint. This in turn will act as a mint-pass allowing them to mint a three-piece digital wearable set for free which will mark the first in a series of collections of digital wearable collaborations between Alma and Jack Irving.",
  },
  {
    q: "WHAT UTILITY DOES HOLDING A TOWER PROVIDE?",
    a: "Individual towers collectibles will have their own utility which will be revealed over time via series of quests, but immediately following the mint collectors of all six towers will be rewarded by a seventh rare and unique tower collectible, which will allow them to mint for free the first set of digital wearables that form the first in a series of future collaborations between Alma and Jack Irving.",
  },
  {
    q: "WHERE CAN I FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT?",
    a: "Follow our Twitter @almaxjackirving for drop information and further information about future utility and the digital wearables collections that will follow the initial mint.",
